# Array
Organizes items sequentially - one after another in memory.
If all you need is to store some data and iterate through it one by one, arrays are the best choice.

|Index|Item|
|:---|:---|
|0|Some item at index 0|
|1|Some item at index 1|
|2|Some item at index 2|
|3|Some item at index 3|
|4|Some item at index 4|

# Time complexity of basic operations

|Operation|BigO|
|:---|:---|
|Access|`O(1)`|
|Search|`O(n)`|
|Insertion|`O(n)`|
|Deletion|`O(n)`|
